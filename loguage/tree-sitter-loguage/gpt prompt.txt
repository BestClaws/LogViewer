ok. so here's my language

this is actually a splunk like language to search for stuff in logs.

at its basic form. this is how it looks

[ search hi ]

this searches for hi.

 a query will always start and end with [ and ] respectively.
first letter inside query is the operation we want to do. here it is search any thing after search argument is the search expression

in our case we're searching the term hi 
| (pipe) symbol is used to feed output of one operation to other 

[ search hi | fields x ]


queries can contain sub queries


[ search hi [search hello] | fields x]





search expressions can be complex. likek

hi AND how
NOT how

we can use paranthesis for precedence

hi AND (how OR NOT hello)

order of precedence in absent of paranthesis is


NOT > AND > OR
